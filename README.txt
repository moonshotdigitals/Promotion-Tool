This plugin allows store owners to configure and apply BOGO (Buy One Get One) deals in WooCommerce with advanced rule handling and dynamic pricing logic.

== Description ==

**BOGO Promotion Tool** is a WooCommerce plugin that enables you to create flexible Buy One Get One offers, helping you boost sales and incentivize larger cart sizes. Configure exact match or category-based rules to give products away for free, at a discount, or with quantity limitations.

Whether you're running a seasonal sale, upselling on certain products, or offering tiered deals â€” this plugin gives you the dynamic tools to implement BOGO strategies with ease.

**Key Features:**

* Create BOGO rules based on product or category
* Support for exact quantity triggers (e.g., Buy 2 Get 1)
* Free or percentage-discounted bonus items
* Apply dynamic pricing automatically
* Restrict or hide quantity selectors for bonus products
* Real-time cart validation to ensure rule conditions are met
* Admin UI under "Promotion Tool" for managing offers

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
